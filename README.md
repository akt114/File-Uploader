# File-Uploader
This  AJAX File uploader uses NodeJS as backend and HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT for frontend.
I have also used particles-js which makes it look more attracive.
It also has progress bars to show the percentage of file uploaded at a particular instant.

You can see the screenshots of this app in the "uploads" folder in this repository.(https://github.com/akt114/File-Uploader)
